# OncoSys Cancer AI Lab: Healthcare AI Hackathon

**Left:** a real H&E slide from TCGA (patient TCGA-OL-A5RW). **Right:** a published AI model's estimate of where tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are. Its highest patch probability is 0.63, and at its own threshold it calls just one patch positive. **Is that result right, and how would anyone check?** That's what you'll build tools for.

- **Explore the data:** seven data packs (tumor molecular data, tissue images, CT scans, cell lines, trial records) plus a 30-minute warm-up. The menu shows included starters, source downloads and viewer links.
- **Pick a mission:** six featured products and optional custom builds, across two tracks.
- **Run the starter:** download the notebook, see how each join shrinks the cohort, and find a matching pathology slide. Opening the slide depends on the external IDC viewer.

## Pick a user, build one workflow
| Track | What it does | Featured products |
|---|---|---|
| **Cohort Firewall** | Catches what could make a result unreliable | [Cohort Control Tower](products/cohort-control-tower.md) · [Cohort Studio](products/cohort-studio.md) |
| **Evidence Navigator** | Helps someone investigate a result and decide what to do | [Multimodal Case Room](products/multimodal-case-room.md) · [Evidence Copilot](products/evidence-copilot.md) · [Research Claim Auditor](products/research-claim-auditor.md) · [Repair Review Desk](products/repair-review-desk.md) |

Build a web app, an AI agent, a visual workflow, or a tool that plugs into a notebook. You can also combine two products or [pitch your own](products/README.md#pitch-your-own-lighter-support).

**The bar:** a judge can use your workflow without you narrating, and it shows **one result they can verify** and **one limitation they can inspect.**

**The finale:** a Cohort Control Tower catches a silent change in a new data release, and a different team's Repair Review Desk receives the findings and makes the review decision, live, through the [shared format](format/README.md).

## The data packs
| Pack | One record is… | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [TCGA breast cancer](data/tcga-brca/README.md) *(core)* | A tumor sample with clinical, survival, mutation, copy number, RNA and protein data, plus slide links | Ready |
| [Pathology: PathMNIST](data/pathmnist/README.md) | A labelled colorectal tissue patch | Ready |
| [Molecular + imaging: CPTAC](data/cptac/README.md) | A lung, colon or kidney cancer case | Ready: protein, slides and CT links |
| [Imaging: LIDC-IDRI](data/lidc-idri/README.md) | A chest CT with radiologists' nodule marks | Ready |
| [Prediction: DepMap](data/depmap/README.md) | A cancer cell line | Ready |
| [Trial records: ClinicalTrials.gov](data/clinical-trials/README.md) | A dated trial record + fictional cases | Ready for practice |
| [Advanced: CAMELYON17](data/camelyon17/README.md) | A lymph-node slide from one of 5 hospitals | Ready (source-linked) |

**Only join records where a documented match exists.** Tissue patches, cell lines, tumor samples and CT scans describe different things. See [the joining rule](data/README.md#the-joining-rule).

## What's in this repo
| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `starter/tcga_starter.ipynb` | The 15-minute starter |
| `products/` | Six featured product briefs, practice inputs, and pitch-your-own ideas |
| `data/` | Seven data packs: each with a README, sources and checksums, fetch script, and manifests |
| `assets/` | The challenge page image |
| `format/` | Shared findings format v0.2, validator and reference output |
| `warmup/wisconsin/` | Optional 30-minute warm-up on a small dataset |
| [`RULES.md`](RULES.md) · [`DATA_LICENSES.md`](DATA_LICENSES.md) | What's allowed, and how to credit the data |
| [`SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`](SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md) | What to check before the code freeze |

## Run the starter

Use **Get the starter notebook** above and download the `.ipynb` file (on GitHub, use **Download raw file**). In Colab, choose **File → Upload notebook**; or open the downloaded file in a Python Jupyter environment with pandas and matplotlib. Run all cells.

The notebook includes its pinned helpers and manifests. It fetches and verifies the research tables directly from UCSC Xena. You need internet access, but no GitHub checkout, GitHub token, or separate helper download after you have the notebook.

Maintainers: if any of the bundled helpers or manifests change, run `python starter/build_portable.py` and commit the regenerated notebook with them. Check it with `python starter/build_portable.py --check`.

## Recommended tools
Use any stack. Start with the smallest toolset that lets someone else rerun your work. No paid account, hosted app, or AI coding assistant is required.

| Task | Optional tools | What to practice |
|---|---|---|
| Read and check the data | [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Polars](https://docs.pola.rs/), or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). For repeatable checks, try [Pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/) or [Great Expectations](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/). [ydata-profiling](https://docs.profiling.ydata.ai/) can help with initial exploration. | Keep sample and patient IDs separate. Record the release, checksums, checks run, and affected samples. Treat a profile report as a starting point, not a verdict. |
| Compare figures | A notebook or SQL is enough. | Compare figures with their denominators. Test whether reasonable choices about which samples to include change the conclusion. |
| Work with slides | NCI Imaging Data Commons viewer links in `slide_manifest.csv`; [`idc-index`](https://pypi.org/project/idc-index/) to download | Distinguish diagnostic from frozen slides. Link a slide to a case only when its barcode matches. |
| Build a reviewer interface | [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started) or [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/docs). Try [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) or [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/) for accessibility checks. | Make it possible to trace a headline number to its evidence and reach a decision without the presenter. Test keyboard navigation and whether labels make sense without color. |
| Use AI responsibly | Any LLM or a local model. Users supply their own key; never commit one. | Let the AI run real queries rather than answer from memory. Show its sources. Make it say when the data can't answer. |
| Document provenance | The [shared format](format/README.md), a Markdown evidence log, or [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) as background | For each claim, record the release, samples, calculation, limitation, and who should review it. |
| Check for secrets | [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks), manually or in pre-commit | Before submitting, check for credentials, tokens, private URLs and restricted files. |
